# Architecture

## Glass Box team boundaries

This is the integration scaffold for Glass Box in `ncentis/pure_vibes`; read `AGENTS.md` before editing. Nick owns Glass Box prompts/checkpoints/contracts, review/MCP API routes, scripts, fixtures, and Supabase migrations. Kathryn owns approval/dashboard/profile UI, shared components, global CSS, and public assets. George owns auth, Stripe, CI, deployment configuration, package manifest, and internal docs. `src/lib/glassbox/types.ts` is Nick-owned shared UI/API contract: ask Nick before changing it; after 3:00pm PT on hackathon day only additive changes are allowed. Cross-owner PRs disclose touched areas and need each owner's approval before merge.

Only Nick creates migrations or applies them to the shared Supabase project. Other developers can run local database tests. Never rewrite an already-pushed migration; add a new one. Describe and get explicit approval for shared/destructive actions before running them. See `docs/TEAM_SETUP.md` for the hackathon PR and freeze cadence.

## Integration map

```text
Browser → Next.js page / API routes (Vercel Node runtime)
          ├─ Supabase Auth: cookie session → verified user
          ├─ Supabase Postgres: user-scoped reads under RLS
          ├─ AI SDK → OpenAI: normalize brief → structured plan
          │            └─ privileged, authorized run persistence
          └─ Stripe: Checkout / customer portal
Stripe → signed webhook → current subscription lookup → transactional DB sync
```

The starter page is a developer test console, not the final product UI. Environment-dependent clients initialize only when used, so CI builds succeed without secrets.

## Routes

| Route                        | Purpose                                               | Access                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/health`            | App liveness only, no provider probe                  | Public                                                        |
| `POST /api/auth/sign-in`     | `{ "email": "..." }` → magic link                     | Same origin; Supabase Auth limits                             |
| `GET /auth/callback`         | Exchange PKCE code for session                        | Valid auth code                                               |
| `POST /api/auth/sign-out`    | Sign out this browser                                 | Same origin                                                   |
| `GET /api/workflows`         | Latest 20 runs for this user                          | Verified user + RLS                                           |
| `POST /api/workflows`        | `{ "brief": "..." }` → saved structured plan          | Same origin + verified user + quota (+ optional subscription) |
| `POST /api/billing/checkout` | Redirect URL for server-configured subscription price | Same origin + verified user                                   |
| `POST /api/billing/portal`   | Redirect URL for this user's Stripe customer          | Same origin + verified user                                   |
| `POST /api/stripe/webhook`   | Sync subscription lifecycle                           | Raw-body Stripe signature                                     |

JSON API mutations expect the exact `APP_URL` origin. For manual curl requests, include `Origin: http://localhost:3000` plus a valid session cookie; curl does not create authentication for you. Browser controls call these routes directly.

## Database boundaries

- `workflow_runs`: input, output, model, status, timestamps, and successful call token totals. Authenticated users can read only their own rows; writes are server-owned.
- `billing_customers`: one app user ↔ one Stripe customer; server-created before Checkout. No ownership inferred from email or untrusted request metadata.
- `subscriptions`: one row per Stripe subscription, allowing multiple historical canceled subscriptions without losing current state.
- `stripe_events`: private deduplication ledger; insert and subscription update share one transaction.
- `reserve_workflow`: service-only RPC using a per-user advisory lock to enforce the hourly quota across serverless instances.
- `sync_subscription`: service-only RPC; older event timestamps cannot overwrite newer ones.

Supabase's privileged client bypasses RLS. Keep it in server-only modules and derive user IDs from verified authentication, never from JSON bodies. End-user clients have no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE grants on these tables or execute grants on privileged functions. SQL tests cover isolation, write restrictions, quota, duplicate events, and stale events.

## Auth and caching

`src/proxy.ts` refreshes Supabase sessions and forwards updated cookies/cache headers. API routes verify users with `getUser()`. Private API responses use `Cache-Control: private, no-store`; the home page is dynamic. No user-specific response is statically cached. Webhooks bypass the auth proxy.

## AI extension point

Edit `src/lib/ai/workflow.ts`. The included workflow is deliberately generic:

1. Normalize the supplied brief using a bounded text call.
2. Generate and validate an action plan using a Zod schema.
3. Persist the completed output and aggregate successful-call token counts.

This is **request-time orchestration**, not durable background execution. The route waits for completion; jobs do not resume after a process kill. An interrupted invocation can leave a `running` row, and a provider failure may incur usage without complete token accounting. The UI makes missing results visible. Move long-running jobs to a durable queue/workflow service (for example Vercel Workflow, Inngest, or Trigger.dev) with per-step idempotency and job reconciliation when the product requires it. Do not launch unawaited promises in a Vercel function.

Prompts are stored in the database and sent to the configured AI provider. Define product-specific retention and deletion behavior before collecting sensitive customer inputs. No AI tool can spend money, execute shell commands, or mutate customer data in this example.

## Billing semantics and limits

The sample supports one recurring price and assumes one subscription item. Checkout guards existing subscriptions, reuses open sessions, and uses a 30-minute-bucket idempotency key for duplicate requests. This reduces accidental double-clicks, but is not a distributed exactly-one-subscription guarantee around time-bucket boundaries or external Stripe changes. Add a database-backed checkout lock and reconciliation if the product needs that guarantee.

Webhooks retrieve the latest Stripe subscription and apply event timestamp ordering plus deduplication. Stripe timestamps have second precision; concurrent deliveries and external edits can still require reconciliation. This is an eventually consistent local billing view. Before launching payment-critical entitlements, add a scheduled Stripe-to-database reconciliation job. Missing/unmapped customers are ignored because other apps can share an account. Persistence failures return 500 for Stripe retries.

Optional AI entitlement accepts only `active` / `trialing` rows for the configured price. It does not treat the Checkout success query string as evidence of payment. `past_due`, `unpaid`, and canceled subscriptions do not grant access; cancel-at-period-end remains active until Stripe changes status. Choose grace-period policy as a product decision.

Deleting an Auth user cascades local app records but does not cancel their Stripe subscription. A future account-deletion flow must coordinate cancellation/customer cleanup before deleting the user. There is no account-deletion endpoint in this scaffold.

## Configuration and verification

- `.env.example` documents values; `npm run setup` copies without overwriting local work.
- `npm run env:check` checks presence and URL syntax, not connectivity or permission.
- `npm run check` runs lint, strict TypeScript, and unit tests without external credentials.
- `npm run db:test` requires local Supabase + Docker. GitHub Actions supplies the Docker runner.
- `npm run build` verifies Next.js production compilation without contacting providers.
- Follow `TEAM_SETUP.md` for live acceptance tests; mocked tests cannot prove account permissions or webhook delivery.

The scaffold was built with no cloud credentials. No projects, subscriptions, products, invitations, or deployments were created automatically.
